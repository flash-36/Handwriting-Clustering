# Handwriting-Clustering
Raw input + Kmeans

Take in images of handwritten characters(pictures of class notes or something) and cluster them into 'cno' number of clusters and store each cluster in different folders.

cno = number of clusters
source_folder = path to dataset
dest_folder = path to output
mindim = size of the smallest edge of all the images in your dataset


#Note: For optimum results make sure the photos are more or less identical(same angle of capture of the image,same distance from the page,similar lighting conditions and same color of ink used to write)
