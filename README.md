# Handwriting-Clustering
Raw input + Kmeans

Take in images of handwritten characters(pictures of class notes or something) and cluster them into 'cno' number of clusters and store each cluster in different folders.

cno = number of clusters
source_folder = path to dataset
dest_folder = path to output
mindim = size of the smallest edge of all the images in your dataset
